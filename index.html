            <p>becoming posthuman is a one-day multimedia <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/174088576497818/">event</a> in boston, massachusetts focusing on digital culture. The event will be kickstarted in the afternoon by a series of short talks and workshops, and followed by a night of visual art, performances, and music.</p>

        <p>our idea of posthumanism is not anti-humanism, but rather a proposal to examine and question the historical notions of “human nature”, and challenge typical notions of human subjectivity and embodiment.</p>

        <p>we are calling for submissions of visual art of all mediums, proposal for talks and/or workshops, and anything (including activities) you could see fit into this event.</p>

        <p>we are looking for works that address topics including but not limited to: digital intimacy, online identity, computer graphics, internet of things, robotics, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, cyber-poetry, crypto-currency, cyberfeminism, cybernetics, open-source culture, cyberwarfare, decentralization and the internet, sex and the internet, etc.</p>
            
        <p>for submissions of artwork, include a link to portfolio website, instagram, or Youtube/Vimeo, a short artist bio (less than 100 words), a short artist statement (less than 100 words), and pictures or links to videos of work being submitted.</p>
            
        <p>for submissions of talks and workshops, include a short bio and a proposal.</p>
            
        <p>all submissions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:becomingposthuman@gmail.com" target="_top">becomingposthuman@gmail.com</a></p>
