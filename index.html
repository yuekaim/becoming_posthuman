        <h1>FEATURED ARTISTS</h1>
        <p>
            ✰ <a href="http://mshr.info/">MSHR</a> is the art collective of Birch Cooper and Brenna Murphy. Their work meshes digital sculpture, analog circuitry and ceremonial performance. They construct and perform cybernetic compositions using synthesizers of our own design. For exhibitions, they install macro-arrangements of these sculptural instruments to create immersive light-sound-scapes. In our performances, we engage the systems through a series of unique interfaces. We also work with 3d modeling programs to design virtual reality spaces, embedded with generative computer music systems. MSHR's sculptural, musical and electronic work inform each other deeply, creating the meta-form that is our collaborative practice.
MSHR emerged from the art collective Oregon Painting Society in 2011. We were artists in residence at Sonoscopia, 2014; Eyebeam, 2014; Pioneer Works, 2016; Signal Culture, 2016. We are represented by Upfor.

        ✰ <a href="https://twitter.com/archmixes">Sam Ghantous</a> explores architecture’s tension with technology and its effects on cultural production, working both online and in real life with objects, images, situations, and installations. He received his Master of Architecture from the MIT School of Architecture and Planning, where he currently holds a 2017-2018 Teaching Fellowship. Sam’s artistic practice is represented by YveYang Gallery in New York, and he has exhibited in Toronto, New York, Cambridge, and Shanghai (expected).<br><br>
            Today, Architecture exists more as images than lived experiences. @archmixes is a twitter bot that allows one to tweet new architecture made as a mash-up, or post-production, from amateur 3d models of famous buildings found online. Replies from the bot are transmitted back to the user as an image, 3d model, a Shopify listing, and a Pin. By flattening historical sources and networks of authorship, and assuming the everyday medium of the tweet, the bot’s ability to make architecture as images might give it the chance to engage public once again through its ability to “get around.”

        ✰ <a href="https://vimeo.com/alifibrahim">Alif Ibrahim</a> is a multimedia artist from Jakarta, Indonesia. His work investigates elements of global wellness, digitization of the body and lingering sensations of the early internet.<br><br>

The human body has undergone serious datafication, where we are not identified by what we are but what part of we are captured. Coupled with the liberal and almost casual belief in spurious correlation that underlies big data, government programs like Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) and fervent and dogmatic use of biometrics in passing through national borders lead to an evaluation of us as the post-human. <br><br>

You are not who I know you are is a 5-channel video installation that connects the idea of permeating borders with the uprising in dividualization in control societies. The 5 videos loop on different durations, as each viewer is encouraged to form their own narrative and understanding of how an immigrant’s body is judged by a post-human standard.<br><br>
