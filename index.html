        <h1>FEATURED ARTISTS</h1>
        <p>
            ✰ <a href="http://mshr.info/">MSHR</a> {video}
MSHR is the art collective of Birch Cooper and Brenna Murphy. Their work meshes digital sculpture, analog circuitry and ceremonial performance. They construct and perform cybernetic compositions using synthesizers of our own design. For exhibitions, they install macro-arrangements of these sculptural instruments to create immersive light-sound-scapes. In our performances, we engage the systems through a series of unique interfaces. We also work with 3d modeling programs to design virtual reality spaces, embedded with generative computer music systems. MSHR's sculptural, musical and electronic work inform each other deeply, creating the meta-form that is our collaborative practice.
MSHR emerged from the art collective Oregon Painting Society in 2011. We were artists in residence at Sonoscopia, 2014; Eyebeam, 2014; Pioneer Works, 2016; Signal Culture, 2016. We are represented by Upfor.

Piece in the show: re-Upstart (2017)<br><br>

This is a slightly updated version of Upstart (2013) that follows the same 
principle for generating new, yet familiar, company names. In addition to 
engaging with naming in his artistic and poetic practice, Nick Montfort is 
the principal of Nomnym.com, a naming company.
